## Obsidian Free Spaced Repetition

**NOTE: This plugin is in very early version and will keep developing for a while. The data structure may change while developing but I will try my best to help migrate from the old version to the new version if need.**

This plugin provides a clean and seamless connection between cards and notes, no extra symbols in notes and seperate scheduler data file. The UI is similar with Anki and the algorithm is using an open-source spaced repetition algorithm called [Free Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler).

### Features

-   Create cards connected to note by writing text or selecting sections.
-   Two tracking mode: Character and Section
    -   Character: Tracking changes within the range you selected first, which means changes outside the original text will not be add to the card.
    -   Section: Tracking changes within the section you selected, which means changes in the same section will be reflected on the card.
-   Anki-like UI

### Roadmap

-   Review reminder
-   Statics view
-   Bulk create cards with template
-   Free review (Extra review)
-   Parameter modifying
